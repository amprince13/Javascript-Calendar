# Module 5 README #

This is our Module 5 project for CSE 330. We created a calendar site that has some basic capabilities.
*  Registered users can login and see events in the calendar
*  Users can add, edit and delete events
*  Only registered users can perform these capabilities


For our creative portion we added the following functionalities
*  Users can share their calendar with other registered users by name
*  Users can filter their events by category
